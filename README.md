This repository contains the final project for the Computer Applications discipline, where we developed a customized version of the classic "Snake" game. The main goal of this project was to apply concepts of programming logic, graphical interface development, and event handling in an interactive environment, using the skills acquired throughout the course.

ðŸŽ®About the Game

In the Snake Game, the player controls a snake that must capture food scattered around the screen to grow and score points. Each item of food collected increases the snake's size, making the game progressively more challenging. The game ends if the snake collides with the screen borders or its own body.

Key Features:

Intuitive controls for snake movement. Real-time score counter displaying the player's performance. Automatic restart when the game is over. Simple, functional visual design suitable for practicing foundational development concepts.

ðŸ’» Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python Graphical Libraries: Pygame IDE Used: VsCOde

ðŸ“š Learning Outcomes and Challenges

Event handling and creating a continuous game loop. Conditional logic for managing scoring and game over scenarios. Working with coordinates and movement to simulate the snakeâ€™s behavior on the screen. This project was an excellent opportunity to strengthen our skills in programming and game design, as well as to develop a final product that is both fun and educational.
